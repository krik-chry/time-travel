      <p>This app was created during the 4-Days-Long Codaisseur Academy Week 10 Hackathon</p>
      <p>
        The subject of the competition was:
      </p>
      <p><u>"Build a Travel App with a Technology not taught by Codaisseur Academy"</u></p>
      <p>The new web programming technology i worked with was <u>Vue.js Framework</u></p>
      <p>
        Making a functional, useful app in 4 days with a new tool was HARD....but it was totally
        worth it!
      </p>
      <p>
