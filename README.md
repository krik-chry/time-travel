# Time Travel App

#### This app was created during the 4-Days-Long Codaisseur Academy Week 10 Hackathon.

#### The subject of the competition was: **_"Build a Travel App with a Technology not taught by Codaisseur Academy"_**

#### The new web programming technology i worked with was **_Vue.js Framework_**

# App content

Î¤he idea for this app is to make use of photo collections that will connect the user easily and quickly to the recent past.

#### There are 6 categories of photo collections :

- Top 10
- Buildings
- Nature
- People
- Aerial Views
- Interior
