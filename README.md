# Time Travel App

### This app was created during the 4-Days-Long Codaisseur Academy Week 10 Hackathon.

### The subject of the competition was: **_"Build a Travel App with a Technology not taught by Codaisseur Academy"_**

### The new web programming technology i worked with was **_Vue.js Framework_**

# App content

### There are 6 categories of photo collections :

- Top 10
- Buildings
